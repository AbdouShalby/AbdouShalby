# Abdelrhman Shalby

Senior Backend Engineer specializing in transaction-safe and high-concurrency backend systems, distributed architectures, and high-traffic production environments.

## Who I Am

Backend engineer with 7+ years of commercial experience building and operating transaction-safe, high-concurrency systems in real production environments.

I design backend systems that handle financial integrity, race conditions, distributed workloads, and infrastructure-level scaling — not just APIs.

My focus is on correctness under pressure, system reliability, and clean architectural decision-making.

---

## Core Expertise

- Transaction-safe financial systems (idempotent APIs, atomic flows)
- High-concurrency order and payment processing
- Distributed locking & race-condition prevention
- Event-driven architectures (queues, async workers)
- High-traffic REST API design
- Database performance optimization (MySQL / PostgreSQL)
- Infrastructure ownership (AWS, Docker, CI/CD)
- Backend team leadership (7 engineers) & hands-on architectural ownership

---

## Production Experience Highlights

- Built and maintained fintech systems handling real monetary transactions
- Designed idempotent payment flows with consistency guarantees
- Optimized high-traffic systems under concurrent load
- Led backend engineers while remaining hands-on in architecture and code
- Owned AWS infrastructure deployment and CI/CD pipelines

### Backend Architecture Case Studies
Deep architectural breakdowns of scalable backend systems including fintech, high-scale marketplaces, real-time notifications, and rate limiting.

Each case study includes:
- Requirements & constraints
- Capacity estimation
- Architectural decisions
- Trade-offs & known risks
- Failure scenarios
- Mitigation strategies
